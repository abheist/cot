			<h3>Why Cotanz Exists?</h3>
			<h4 align="justify">
				Cotanz’s mission is to share and grow the knowledge of students about their collegues and most importantly their college. A vast amount of the knowledge that would be valuable to many people is currently only available to a few — either locked in people’s heads, or only accessible to select groups. For example some times news about placements and companies remain only to those who have faced it (seniors) and aspiring students have only vague information regarding all this. We want to connect the people who have knowledge to the people who need it, to bring together people with different perspectives so they can understand each other better, and to empower everyone to share their knowledge for the benefit of the rest of the world.

			<h3>Gather Around a Question</h3>
			<h4 align="justify">
				The heart of Cotanz is questions — questions that affect the college and its people, questions that explain recent college events, questions that guide important life decisions, and questions that provide insights into why other people think differently. Cotanz is a place where you can ask questions you care about and get answers that are amazing.

				Cotanz has only one version of each question. It doesn’t have a left wing version, a right wing version, a western version, and an eastern version. Cotanz brings together people from different perspectives(branches/departments) to answer the same question, in the same place — and to learn from each other. We want Cotanz to be the place to voice your opinion because Cotanz is where the debate is happening. We want the Cotanz answer to be the definitive answer for everybody forever.
